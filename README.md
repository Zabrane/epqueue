epqueue
================

A high performant Erlang Priority Queue implemented using a binary heap (using NIF)

Concurrency
-----------

The queues provides support for concurrent access. You can specify the concurrent model using `{global_lock, true|false}` option (default is `false`).

Based on `global_lock` option the queue behaves as follow:

- `false` : The process that creates the queue is the only one that can operate on it. If any other process will try to access the queue will fail with a `badarg` exception
- `true` : The returned queue reference can be stored and passed between processes on the same node. Also any process can operate with the queue (a mutex will be used for concurrency control)

Lifetime
-----------

Like any other data a queue reference returned using `epqueue:new` or an item reference returned using `epqueue:insert` are garbaged collected by Erlang VM when there is no longer any reference to them.
The references can be stored and passed between processes on the same node and also sored in a ETS table.

Quick start
-----------

You need to have at least Erlang OTP 19. This is because `enif_binary_to_term` and `enif_term_to_binary` are not available in previous versions.
This can be changed if it's required by moving the encoding/decoding or terms in Erlang and in NIF only store the received binary.

Compile:

```sh
rebar compile
```

or

```sh
rebar3 compile
```

Simple usage:

```erlang
{ok, Q} = epqueue:new([]).
{ok, _Ref} = epqueue:insert(Q, 1, 1).
{ok, 1, 1} = epqueue:peek(Q).
1 = epqueue:size(Q).
{ok, 1, 1} = epqueue:pop(Q).
0 = epqueue:size(Q).
```

API
-----------

- `epqueue:new(Opts)` - Create a new queue. As argument receives a list of settings. The only supported option right now is `{global_lock, true|false}`. For more details read the Concurrency section.
- `insert(QueueRef, Data, Priority)` - Insert an element in the queue with a specified priority. In case of success returns `{ok, ItemRef}`. The reference can be used later in case you want to remove a specific element form the queue.  
- `remove(QueueRef, Ref)` - Remove a specified element from the queue. `Ref` is the one returned by the `epqueue:insert/3` method.
- `pop(QueueRef)` - Removes the element with the lowest priority from the queue (the head element). Returns `{ok, Data, Priority}` in case of success
- `peek(QueueRef)` - Returns the element `{ok, Data, Priority}` with the lowest priority (the head element) without removing it.
- `epqueue:size(QueueRef)` - Get the size of a queue.

Tests
------------

In order to run the integrity tests run `make ct` from project root. 

Performance testing
-----------

From the `test` folder you can use the `benchmark:benchmark_serial(NrElements, MaxPriority, UseLock)` or `benchmark:benchmark_concurrent(NrProcs, NrElements, MaxPriority)` methods to test the performances.

- `benchmark_serial/3` inserts a number of `NrElements` with priorities from 0 to `MaxPriority` in a queue that use or not a lock.
- `benchmark_concurrent/3` spawn a number of `NrProcs` processes that will insert a number of `NrElements` with priorities from 0 to `MaxPriority` in a queue that is mandatory to use a lock.

Results on MacBook Pro (Intel Core i7 4 cores at 2.5 GHz):

```erl
benchmark:benchmark_serial(1000000, 1000000, true).
insert overhead: 252.764 ms insert time: 740.722 ms pop time: 1833.721 ms

insert overhead: 250.178 ms insert time: 726.999 ms pop time: 1771.064 ms 
```

The overhead is the time spent to generate `NrElements` random numbers for the priorities,

```erl
